# Analyzing EIA Data

## Project Description
- Pulls "Annual Crude Production in the U.S., by State" data from the EIA's open data sources through its v2 API
- Cleans and filters the dataset into a Pandas dataframe for ease of analysis
- Summarizes key trends with Seaborn visuals and accompanying (automated) analysis

## API Key:
- The script retrieves data through the EIAâ€™s v2 API which requires an API key
- The key has been omitted from the code to prevent any potential misuse
- Contributors and users alike may register for a fast and free API key here: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php
